In the next couple of posts, I'm going to implement a minimal version of QuickCheck _from scratch_. Follow along and you'll:

 * learn how [QuickCheck](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck) works
 * become better at using it[^1]
 * see a bit of [Quviq's QuickCheck in Erlang](http://quviq.com/documentation/eqc/index.html) as well

I'll be porting tons of Haskell code in F#[^2]. â€” Disclaimer: I've [done](http://blog.nikosbaxevanis.com/2011/11/19/notes-from-porting-java-code-to-net/) [similar](http://blog.nikosbaxevanis.com/2011/11/24/fare-finite-automata-regex-in-net/) [things](http://blog.nikosbaxevanis.com/2015/09/25/regex-constrained-strings-with-fscheck/) in the past. It's fun!

Read this [post](http://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/property-based-testing/) first by [Scott Wlaschin](http://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/), followed by this [Pluralsight course](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/fsharp-property-based-testing-introduction) by [Mark Seemann](http://blog.ploeh.dk/), followed by these [slides](http://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~pbv/aulas/tapf/slides/quickcheck.html) by [Pedro Vasconcelos](http://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~pbv/index_en.html). There's also this [short intro](/2016/02/09/short-intro-to-quickcheck/) as well.
